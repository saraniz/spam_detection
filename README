# SpamShield

📧 **SpamShield** is an intelligent email classification system that detects **spam** and **ham** messages using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It provides probability scores for spam/ham, highlights top contributing keywords, and visualizes historical classification insights.
